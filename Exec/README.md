For example problems, please see the /Tutorials directory.

This directory contains inputs files for IAMR's regression tests.
Note that the regression tests are designed to test the code, and
therefore might not always use the most physically meaningful parameters.
IAMR/Test/README.md has more information about the
regression tests, including how to set them up for your own IAMR fork.

The subdirectories group together tests:
 * /eb_run2d and /eb_run3d contain problems with embedded boundaries
 * /run2d and /run3d contain problems without embedded boundaries
 * /run_2d_particles uses pasively advected particles without EB, although
   using an EB is possible
