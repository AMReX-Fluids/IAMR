Controlling What’s in the PlotFile
==================================

There are a few options that can be set at runtime to control what
variables appear in the plotfile. See section :ref:`sec:InputsPlotfiles`.

Amrvis
======

Amrvis is a package developed
by CCSE that is designed specifically for highly efficient visualization
of block-structured hierarchical AMR data.
Information on building the amrvis2d and amrvis3d executables is given in section
:ref:`Visualizing the Results`. A very useful feature of Amrvis is
View :math:`\rightarrow` Dataset, which
allows you to actually view the numbers in a spreadsheet that is nested
to reflect the AMR hierarchy – this can be handy for
debugging. You can modify how many levels of data you want to see,
whether you want to see the grid boxes or not, what palette you use,
etc.

If you like to have amrvis display a certain variable, at a certain
scale, when you first bring up each plotfile (you can always change it
once the amrvis window is open), you can modify the amrvis.defaults
file in your directory to have amrvis default to these settings every
time you run it. The Amrvis repository has a sample amrvis.defaults
file that can be copied to your local folder and modified.

VisIt
=====

VisIt is also a great visualization tool, and it supports AMReXAMR data natively. To open a AMReX plotfile, select File
:math:`\rightarrow` Open file :math:`\rightarrow` Open file as type Boxlib, and
choose the Header file within the plotfile folder, plt00000/Header,
For more information check out visit.llnl.gov.

yt
=====

yt is a free and open-source software that provides data analysis and
publication-level visualization tools. It is geared more for astrophysical
simulation results, but may be useful for your purposes. As yt is script-based, it’s not
as easy to use as VisIt, and certainly not as easy as Amrvis, but the
images can be worth it! Here we do not flesh out yt, but give an
overview intended to get a person started. Full documentation and
explanations from which this section was adapted can be found at
http://yt-project.org/doc/index.html.

yt can be installed by the following commands:

$ wget http://hg.yt-project.org/yt/raw/stable/doc/install\_script.sh

$ bash install\_script.sh

This installs yt in your current directory. To update yt in the
future, simply do

$ yt update

in your “yt-hg” folder.

AMReX Data in yt
----------------

yt was originally created for simple analysis and visualization of
data from the Enzo code. Since, it has grown to include support for a
variety of codes, including IAMR.
However, yt will still sometimes
make assumptions, especially about data field names, that favor Enzo
and cause errors with AMReX data. These problems can usually be
avoided by taking care to specify the data fields desired in
visualization. For example, Enzo’s density field is called
“Density,” and is the default for many plotting mechanisms when the
user does not specify the field. However, IAMR does not have a field
called “Density”; instead, the density field is called “density.”
If a user does not specify a field while plotting with IAMR data,
chances are that yt will try (and fail) to find “Density” and return
an error. As you will see in the examples, however, there is a way to
create your own fields from existing ones. You can use these derived
fields as you would use any other field.

There are also a few imperatives when it comes to reading in your
AMReX simulation data and associated information. First and foremost
is that the inputs file for the simulation **must** exist in the
same directory as where the plotfile directory is located, and it **must** be named “**inputs**.” yt reads information from the
inputs file such as the number of levels in the simulation run, the
number of cells, the domain dimensions, and the simulation time.
When specifying a plotfile as
the data source for plots, you may simply call it by its directory
name, rather than using the Header file as in VisIt. As a final
caveat, yt requires the existence of the job\_info file within the plotfile
directory.

The following examples for yt were taken from the Castro user guide,
and so have a strong astrophysics bent to them, but is still useful
in the context of combustion. The only subtlety is that Castro 
works in CGS units.

Interacting with yt: Command Line and Scripting
-----------------------------------------------

yt is written completely in python (if you don’t have python, yt will
install it for you) and there are a number of different ways to
interact with it, including a web-based gui. Here we will cover
command-line yt and scripts/the python interactive prompt, but other
methods are outlined on the yt webpage at
http://yt-project.org/doc/interacting/index.html.

The first step in starting up yt is to activate the yt environment:

$ source $YT\_DEST/bin/activate

From the command line you can create simple plots, perform simple
volume renderings, print the statistics of a field for your data set,
and do a few other things. Try $ yt to see a list of commands,
and $ yt :math:`<`\ command\ :math:`>` --help
to see the details of a command. The command line is the easiest way
to get quick, preliminary plots – but the simplicity comes at a
price, as yt will make certain assumptions for you. We could plot a
projection of density along the x-axis for the plotfile (yt calls it a
parameter file) plt\_def\_00020 by doing the following:

$ yt plot -p -a 0 -f density plt\_def\_00020

Or a temperature-based volume rendering with 14 contours:

$ yt render -f Temp --contours 14 plt\_def\_00020

Any plots created from the command line will be saved into a
subfolder called “frames.” The command line is nice for fast
visualization without immersing yourself too much in the data, but
usually you’ll want to specify and control more details about your
plots. This can be done either through scripts or the python
interactive prompt. You can combine the two by running scripts within
the interactive prompt by the command

:math:`>>>` execfile(‘script.py’)

which will leave you in the interactive prompt, allowing you to
explore the data objects you’ve created in your script and debug
errors you may encounter. While in the yt environment, you can access
the interactive prompt by $ *python* or the shortcut

$ pyyt

Once you’re in the yt environment and in a .py script or the
interactive prompt, there are a couple of points to know about the
general layout of yt scripting. Usually there are five sections to a
yt script:

#. Import modules

#. Load parameter files and saved objects

#. Define variables

#. Create and modify data objects, image arrays, plots,
   etc. :math:`\rightarrow` this is the meat of the script

#. Save images and objects

Note that neither saving nor loading objects is necessary, but can be
useful when the creation of these objects is time-consuming, which is
often the case during identification of clumps or contours.

yt Basics
---------

The first thing you will always want to do is to import yt:

:math:`>>>` from yt.mods import \*

Under certain circumstances you will be required to import more, as we
will see in some of the examples, but this covers most of it,
including all of the primary functions and data objects provided by
yt. Next, you’ll need yt to access the plotfile you’re interested in
analyzing. Remember, you must have the “inputs” file in the same
folder:

:math:`>>>` pf = load(‘plt\_def\_00020’)

When this line is executed, it will print out some key parameters from
the simulation. However, in order to access information about all of
the fluid quantities in the simulation, we must use the “hierarchy”
object. It contains the geometry of the grid zones, their parent
relationships, and the fluid states within each one. It is easily
created:

:math:`>>>` pf.h

Upon execution, yt may print out a number of lines saying it’s adding
unknown fields to the list of fields. This is because IAMR has
different names for fields than what yt expects. We can see what
fields exist through the commands

:math:`>>>` print pf.h.field\_list

:math:`>>>` print pf.h.derived\_field\_list

There may not be any derived fields for the IAMR data. We can find out
the number of grids and cells at each level, the simulation time, and
information about the finest resolution cells:

:math:`>>>` pf.h.print\_stats()

You can also find the value and location of the maximum of a field in
the domain:

:math:`>>>` value, location = pf.h.find\_max(‘density’)

The list goes on. A full list of methods and attributes associated
with the heirarchy object (and most any yt object or function) can be
accessed by the help function:

:math:`>>>` help(pf.h)

You can also use :math:`>>>` *dir()* on an object or
function to find out which names it defines. Check the
yt documentation for help. Note that you may not always need to create
the hierarchy object. For example, before calling
functions like find\_max; yt will construct it automatically if it
does not already exist.

Data Containers and Selection
-----------------------------

Sometimes, you’ll want to select, analyze, or plot only portions of
your simulation data. To that end, yt includes a way to create data
“containers” that select data based on geometric bounds or fluid
quantity values. There are many, including rays, cylinders, and clumps
(some in the examples, all described in the documentation), but the
easiest to create is a sphere, centered on the location of the maximum
density cell we found above:

:math:`>>>` my\_data\_container = pf.h.sphere(location, 5.0e4/pf[‘km’])

Here, we put the radius in units of kilometers using a
conversion. When specifying distances in yt, the default is to use the
simulation-native unit named “1”, which is probably identical to one
of the other units, like “m”. The pf.h.print\_stats() command lists
available units. We can access the data within the container:

:math:`>>>` print my\_data\_container[‘density’]

:math:`>>>` print my\_data\_container.quantities[‘Extrema’]([‘density’, ‘pressure’])

When the creation of objects is time-consuming, it can be convenient
to save objects so they can be used in another session. To save an
object as part of the .yt file affiliated with the heirarchy:

:math:`>>>` pf.h.save\_object(my\_data\_container, ‘sphere\_to\_analyze\_later’)

Once it has been saved, it can be easily loaded later:

:math:`>>>` sphere\_to\_analyze = pf.h.load\_object(‘sphere\_to\_analyze\_later’)

Grid Inspection
---------------

yt also allows for detailed grid inspection. The hierarchy object
possesses an array of grids, from which we can select and examine
specific ones:

:math:`>>>` print pf.h.grids

:math:`>>>` my\_grid = pf.h.grids[4]

Each grid is a data object that carries information about its
location, parent-child relationships (grids within which it resides, and
grids that reside within it, at least in part), fluid quantities, and
more. Here are some of the commands:

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid.Level

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid\_ActiveDimensions

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid.LeftEdge

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid.RightEdge

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid.dds

(dds is the size of each cell within the grid).

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid.Parent

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid.Children[2].LeftEdge

:math:`>>>` print my\_grid[‘Density’]

You can examine which cells within the grid have been refined with the
child\_mask attribute, a representative array set to zero everywhere
there is finer resolution.To find the fraction of your grid that isn’t
further refined:

:math:`>>>`\ print my\_grid.child\_mask.sum()/float(my\_grid.ActiveDimensions.prod())

Rather than go into detail about the many possibilities for plotting
in yt, we’ll provide some examples.

Example Scripts
---------------

In these examples, we investigate 3-D simulation data of two stars
orbiting in the center of the domain, which is a box of sides
