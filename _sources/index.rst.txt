Welcome to IAMR's documentation!
================================

IAMR is a parallel, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code that uses
subcycling in time and solves the variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
in the presence of complex geometries.
It is built on top of AMReX, a publicly available software framework designed for
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications.

The IAMR source code is available at
https://amrex-codes.github.io/IAMR/

For an AMReX-based incompressible flow code without subcycling in time,
see incflo (https://amrex-codes.github.io/incflo/)
