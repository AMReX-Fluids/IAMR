Debugging
===========================

Here we offer some tips we have found useful when debugging.

If the code is crashing, compile with ``DEBUG=TRUE`` and then examine the Backtrace file
produced from running with the debug executable. Using the debug executable will also
turn on additional checks within the code (these are ``AMREX_ASSERT()`` statements).
Many times, these additional checks or the Backtrace can point you to the problem.

It can be helpful to simplify the problem as much as possible before digging into debugging.
For example, reduce the problem size and set ``amr.max_level`` as small as possible.
Diffusion and viscosity can be turned off by setting ``ns.vel_visc_coef = 0`` and
``ns.scal_diff_coefs = 0``.

Sometimes, restarting from a checkpoint file can reduce the amount of time spent waiting for
the code to fail durning the debugging process.

If the problem only happens with multilevel runs, ``amr.subcycling_mode = None`` will turn
time subcycling off and advance the whole system at the same dt.

Visualizing the data between plotiles can sometimes be helpful.
One option is to use

.. highlight:: c++

::

      void amrex::WriteSingleLevelPlotfile (const std::string &plotfilename,
                                            const MultiFab &mf,
                                            const Vector<std::string> &varnames,
                                            const Geometry &geom,
                                            Real time,
                                            int level_step);

Plotfiles can be compared using AMReX's ``fcompare`` tool found in
``amrex/Tools/Plotfile``.
Another option is to write a ``MultiFab`` to disk with

.. highlight:: c++

::

    amrex::VisMF::Write(const FabArray<FArrayBox>& mf, const std::string& name)

This can then be examined in ``Amrvis`` by passing the ``-mf`` flag.
Two ``MultiFab`` s can be compared using the AMReX tool ``DiffMultiFab`` found in
``amrex/Tools/C_util/DiffMultiFab``.

Please also read AMReX's documentation: :ref:`amrex:sec:basics:debugging`
for more information and tips.
