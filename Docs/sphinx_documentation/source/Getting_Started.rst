Getting Started
===============
This section walks you through a brief introduction to using IAMR.


Downloading the code
--------------------
IAMR is built on top of the AMReX framework.  In order to run
IAMR, you must download separate git modules for IAMR and AMReX.

First, make sure that git is installed on your machine.

Download the AMReX repository by typing:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/amrex-codes/amrex

This will create a folder called ``amrex/`` on your machine.

..
    alternative to `` `` is :code:` `

Download the IAMR repository by typing: 

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/IAMR.git

This will create a folder called ``IAMR/`` on your machine.

You will want to periodically update each of these repositories
by typing ``git pull`` within each repository.




Building the code
-----------------

Here, we walk you through compiling an IAMR executable.

1. ``cd`` to the build directory:

   We build the source code in the ``IAMR/Exec/run2d/`` (for 2D problems) and ``IAMR/Exec/run3d/`` (for 3D) directories.
   Example problems with embedded boundaries are in the ``IAMR/Exec/eb_run2d/`` and ``IAMR/Exec/eb_run3d/`` directories.
   And ``IAMR/Exec/run_2d_particles`` contains an example with passively advected particles.
   A local version of the IAMR executable is built directly in the run folder.
   
2. Edit the ``GNUmakefile``:
   
   Set AMREX_HOME to be the path to the directory where you have put amrex. NOTE: when setting ``AMREX_HOME`` in the ``GNUmakefile``, be aware that ``~`` does not expand, so ``AMREX_HOME=~/amrex/`` will yield an error.

   Alternatively, the path to AMReX can be set up as an environment variable, ``AMREX_HOME``, on your machine to point to the path name where you have put AMReX. For example, if you are using the bash shell, you can add this to your ``.bashrc`` as:

   .. highlight:: bash

   ::

      export AMREX_HOME=/path/to/amrex

   alternatively, in tcsh one can set

   .. highlight:: tcsh
		  
   ::
      
      setenv AMREX_HOME /path/to/amrex


   Other options that you can set in the GNUMakefile include

   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | Option name     | Description                  | Possible values  | Default     |
   |                 |                              |                  | value       |
   +=================+==============================+==================+=============+
   | COMP            | Compiler (gnu or intel)      | gnu / intel      | None        |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | USE_MPI         | Whether to enable MPI        | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | USE_OMP         | Whether to enable OpenMP     | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | USE_CUDA        | Whether to enable CUDA       | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | DEBUG           | Whether to use DEBUG mode    | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | PROFILE         | Include profiling info       | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | TINY_PROFILE    | Include tiny profiling info  | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | COMM_PROFILE    | Include comm profiling info  | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+
   | TRACE_PROFILE   | Include trace profiling info | TRUE / FALSE     | FALSE       |
   +-----------------+------------------------------+------------------+-------------+

   .. note::
      **Do not set both USE_OMP and USE_CUDA to true.**

   Information on using other compilers can be found in the AMReX documentation at
   https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/BuildingAMReX.html .

   
3. Make the executable:

   Now type

   .. code:: shell

      make

   The name of the resulting executable (generated by the make system) encodes several of the build characteristics, including dimensionality of the problem, compiler name, and whether MPI and/or OpenMP were linked with the executable.
   Thus, several different build configurations may coexist simultaneously in a problem folder.
   For example, the default build in ``IAMR/Exec/run3d`` will look
   like ``amr3d.gnu.MPI.ex``, indicating that this is a 3-d version of the code, made with 
   ``COMP=gnu``, and ``USE_MPI=TRUE``.



Running the code
----------------
IAMR takes an input file as its first command-line argument.  The file may
contain a set of parameter definitions that will overrides defaults set in the code.
For example, to run an example in ``IAMR/Exec/run2d``, type:

.. code:: shell

   ./amr2d.gnu.ex inputs.2d.bubble


IAMR typically generates subfolders in the current folder that
are named ``plt00000``, ``plt00010``, etc, and ``chk00000``,
``chk00010``, etc. These are called plotfiles and checkpoint
files. The plotfiles are used for visualization of derived fields; the checkpoint
files are used for restarting the code. The output folders contain a set of ASCII and binary files.  The field
data is generally written in a self-describing binary format; the 
ASCII header files provide additional metadata to give AMR context to the field data.

Visualizing the Results
-----------------------

There are several options for visualizing the data. VisIt supports the AMReX file format
natively, as does the yt python package and ParaView. Amrvis is a package developed
by CCSE that is designed specifically for highly efficient visualization
of block-structured hierarchical AMR data. 
We have also created a number of routines to convert AMReX plotfile data
to other formats (such as MATLAB), but in order to properly interpret
the hierarchical AMR data, each tends to have its own idiosyncrasies.
If you would like to display the data in another format, please let us know
and we will point you to whatever we have that can help.

Here we provide instructions on downloading
and using Amrvis. For more infomation on visualization, including using other software
for visualization, please see the :ref:`Visualization` Section.



#. Get Amrvis:

   ::

       git clone https://ccse.lbl.gov/pub/Downloads/Amrvis.git

   Then cd into Amrvis/, edit the GNUmakefile there
   to set DIM = 2, and again set COMP to the compiler
   suite you have. Leave DEBUG = FALSE.

   Type make to build, resulting in an executable that
   looks like amrvis2d...ex.

   If you want to build amrvis with DIM = 3, you must first
   download and build volpack:

   ::

       git clone https://ccse.lbl.gov/pub/Downloads/volpack.git

   Then cd into volpack/ and type make.

   Note: Amrvis requires the OSF/Motif libraries and headers. If you don’t have these
   you will need to install the development version of motif through your package manager.
   lesstif gives some functionality and will allow you to build the amrvis executable,
   but Amrvis may exhibit subtle anomalies.

   On most Linux distributions, the motif library is provided by the
   openmotif package, and its header files (like Xm.h) are provided
   by openmotif-devel. If those packages are not installed, then use the
   OS-specific package management tool to install them.

   You may then want to create an alias to amrvis2d, for example

   ::

       alias amrvis2d /tmp/Amrvis/amrvis2d.gnu.ex

#. Return to the IAMR/Exec/run2d folder. You should
   have a number of output files, including some in the form pltXXXXX,
   where XXXXX is a number corresponding to the timestep the file
   was output. To see a single plotfile, type

   .. code:: shell

      amrvis2d <filename> 

   .. figure:: ./GettingStarted/IAMR_Plot.png
      :alt:  Amrvis visualization tool
      :width: 2.50000in

      Amrvis visualization tool
	      
   Or to animate the sequence of plotfiles, use

   .. code:: shell

      amrvis2d -a plt\*
	      
   Within Amrvis you can change which variable you are
   looking at and/or select a region and click “Dataset” (under View)
   in order to look at the actual numbers. You can also export the
   pictures in several different formats under “File/Export”.
